# Simulating Quantum Communications: A Beginner's Tutorial

This repository contains a series of quantum entanglement simulations using Markov processes for tracking errors. Each folder corresponds to an article in our tutorial series on simulating quantum entanglements for beginners. 
We currently have [one article](https://medium.com/@amar.abane.phd/simulating-quantum-communications-a-beginners-tutorial-part-i-03224c2a4108), with more to follow.

## Overview

The simulations model entanglement distribution between two quantum nodes using noisy quantum memories and a lossy quantum channel. Key features include:

- **Bell State Generation:** Simulation of photon emissions, channel losses, memory errors, and Bell state measurement.
- **Distance Variation:** Investigation of how increasing channel distances affect the fidelity of the generated (Phi+) state.
- **Performance Metrics:** Analysis and plotting of fidelity, full Bell state ratios, entanglement generation rate, and entanglement generation probability.

## Repository Contents

Each folder corresponds to an article in the tutorial series:

- **`article1`**  
  Contains a simulation demonstrating how increasing channel distances impact the fidelity of generated Bell states, as well as the entanglement generation rate and probability.

*(Additional articles will be added in separate folders as the series progresses.)*

## Running the Simulations

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-entanglement-simulation.git
   cd quantum-entanglement-simulation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   The simulation requires Python 3 and the following packages:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`

   Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

To run the simulation and generate the plots for the first article:

1. **Navigate to the Article Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd article1
   ```

2. **Run the Simulation Script:**

   ```bash
   python simulation.py
   ```
